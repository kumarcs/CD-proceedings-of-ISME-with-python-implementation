Ambedkar National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar</b>.  Also it is a matter of great delight that academicians, researchers and industry experts are actively participating and sharing their innovative ideas and thoughts in the conference to shape the future India.
The conference, I am sure, will certainly provide a common platform for young scientists and engineers from various R&D, industrial organizations and faculty from academic institutions for fruitful interaction and exchange of ideas and disseminate information on mechanical design innovations as well as state-of-the art information in the context of mechanical engineering for the good of mankind as well as for the development of the nation in particular.
<br><br>I am sure the deliberations will certainly stimulate the young researchers, who are the future hope of our nation, to achieve unprecedented land marks in mechanical engineering. I am confident that it will have a significant impact on engineering education, research practice and development. The spirit of the conference lies in the belief that sharing experiences is inevitable for sustainable development with mechanical systems.
I wish to take this opportunity to invite the academicians and researchers from far and wide to this beautiful campus of NIT Jalandhar. I wish them a pleasant stay. I hope the participants will return home with cherished memories and enriched knowledge from the experiences of this international conference.</p>

          Research is a continuous process through which many developments take place for a better life in the world. It is this motivation which has resulted in organizing this <b>19 <sup>th</sup> ISME conference on &apos;Advances in Mechanical Engineering&apos;</b> , covering the utilization of almost all new and advanced mechanical systems in different applications for sustainability. This conference is a blend of science and technology shared between the industrialists, academicians, scientists and technologists.
<br><br>I extend a very warm welcome to all eminent speakers from different IITs, NITs, universities and industries, who have spent their valuable time to share their expertise in the fore front of the conference. I am confident that the deliberations of the conference on mechanical engineering systems and sustainability would be of immense value to the materials and engineering fraternity and shall serve as a knowledge pool and career growth for young scientists, researchers and engineers.
We are grateful to <b>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar</b> for the generous help and support extended by them without which this conference could not have been materialized.
I congratulate the organizers and team for the choice of very relevant themes and the thoughtful contents of the conference. I am confident that the deliberations and interactions in this conference will yield fruitful learning for the delegates. I wish the conference all success.
